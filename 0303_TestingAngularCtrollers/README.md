Welcome to AngularJS Test Driven Development Demo

This folder contains the latest code (as of 9th October 2015) for the Daniel Stern's TutsPlus Course - Angular for Test Driven Development.

Further this folder contains code for the 3rd Chapter Testing Angular Applications - Lesson 03 Testing Angular Controllers. 

Please feel free to download and use the code for your learning or other responsible use.

Deepak Papanna

Notes:
-------
I have made the folder names to be shorter as Windows doesn't like longer folder names when I am copying files across from previous lesson to the next lesson

For example:
0303_Testing Angular Controllers => 0303_TestingAngularCtrollers
